The dataset is obtained from the Census Bureau and represents salaries of people along with seven demographic variables. The following is a description of our dataset:
  
  â€¢ Number of target classes: 2 ('>50K' and '<=50K') [ Labels: 1, 0 ]
  
  â€¢ Number of attributes (Columns): 7
  
  â€¢ Number of instances (Rows): 48,842

The goal of this project is to estimate whether or not someone makes greater than 50k using Decision Trees.
